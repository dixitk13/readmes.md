### [mini-DMTCP](https://github.com/dixitk13/computer-systems/blob/master/mini-DMTCP/myrestart.c) [ [-](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/kapil/courses/cs5600/hw1.html) ]

This is an implementation of mini-DMTCP version. DMTCP is Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing which checkpoints a single-host or distributed computation in user-space  with no modifications to user code or to the O/S.

This checkpoints the hello.c which increments counter, is killed with the help of a makefile which then saves its state and registers in myckpt file. Then its brought back to life with the help of myrestart.c.
Output:

```
./hello.out
counter: 1 PID: 4192
counter: 2 PID: 4192
counter: 3 PID: 4192
counter: 4 PID: 4192
counter: 5 PID: 4192
counter: 6 PID: 4192
make: *** [check] Killed
hello.out killed (pid 4192)
./myrestart.out myckpt
counter: 7 PID: 4196
counter: 8 PID: 4196
counter: 9 PID: 4196
counter: 10 PID: 4196

### [Master-Worker System ](https://github.com/dixitk13/computer-systems/blob/master/master-worker-system/master.c)[ [-](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/kapil/courses/cs5600/hw2.html) ]
A Multi-process solution to compute exponential function using a master-worker architecture.

The master spawns n child worker processes, each of which computes x^n/n!. The Master will communicate with each worker via a separate pipe. The write-end of the pipe is made standard-out of the worker. Uses the following system calls
- SEQUENTIAL(not a system call) : Sequentially reads from workers
-  select : Uses select system call to read from file-descripters
-  poll : Uses poll system call to read from file-descripters
-  epoll : Uses epoll system call to read from file-descripters

The makefile has targets for multiple tests.


### [Malloc Library](https://github.com/dixitk13/computer-systems/blob/master/buddy-algorithm-malloc/malloc.c)[ [-](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/kapil/courses/cs5600/hw3.html) ]
A Malloc library that provides the following dynamic memory allocation

```
- void *malloc(size_t size)
- void free(void *ptr)
- void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
- void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
```

- The implementation uses [buddy allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation) for coalescing free memory within a bucket.  
- Uses sbrk to ask kernel for more memory
- Implements [Malloc Hooks](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-Malloc.html)
- Includes a test threads program which is called by default make target in the makefile
