Time Series Analysis on Yelp Dataset:

Many businesses such as restaurants/shopping centers, have a varying rate of patron activity over a period of a year. Getting an estimate of this activity rate will help business owners take smarter decisions to prepare for the upcoming traffic. In light of this, we decided to use dates of reviews posted on Yelp as time-series data, and predict future activity.
